###Wordpress Revision Slider###

This theme contains modifications to the Wordpress Twenty Fourteen theme which allows revisions to a post to be interactively displayed within the post itself rather than a hidden function. The goal of this software is to get readers comfortable with consuming stories written with version control.  

The main core of this happens in revisionslider.js . Implementation is in single.php and single-revision_slider.php. 

This theme has the following dependencies:

- diff_match_patch.js by Google (https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/)
- WordPress JSON API Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/)
